# hello-world
github initiation
This is my first adventure in github, and I really don't know what I want to share about myself at this time. 
It was suggested that I signup for github to have a place to store whatever scripts I may create.
For the purpose of both keeping them available to myself in the future, and as material to offer future employers.
